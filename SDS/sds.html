							<h2 >2. Component Design</h2>
							<h4 class="comalign"> 2.1 Components Overview </h4>
								<p class="comalign">
								  We will be giving a basic overview of the various components to be used in our system.
								</p>
							<h4 class="comalign"> 2.2 Database </h4>
							<p class="comalign"> SqLite will be used as our database software for Hand held software application and PostgreSQL will be used for our web applications. To represent various data from our project, we will be using tables included within the database software. </p>

							</p>
							<h4 class="comalign"> 2.3 Server Software </h4>
							<p class="comalign">

								Through our server software, we will be able to directly manipulate the contents of our database system based on commands provided from the server procedure proxy.

							</p>

							<h4 class="comalign"> 2.4 Server procedure proxy </h4>
							<p class="comalign">
								we will be provided an interface for us to request information or submit updates to the server through the server procedure proxy. The clients (Teacher) will be given limited access to the server so that they can update the contents._
							</p>

							<h4 class="comalign"> 2.4 Client Software </h4>
							<p class="comalign">
								The client software on which we will present our project will either be on a desktop computer or a hand held device. The software will have two general purposes so that the users can easily update information on the project. Our users will mainly consist of two variants, (Teacher and Student). So for this the software will mainly consist of two interface to accomodate the two different variants.

								<ul>
								<li>
									<strong> Hand held Client Software </strong>
									<br />
									 The hand held client software will allow both type of users to view their varient of the software and they can also make changes and updates relevent to the inteface assign to them.
								</li>

								<br />

								<li>
									<strong> Desktop Client Software </strong>
									<br />
									 The Desktop client software will allow both type of users to view their varient of the software and they can also make changes and updates relevent to the inteface assign to them.
								</li>

								<br />

							</ul>
