# Reading_App-Read_It
I made this project when i was doing CSE 327 ( Software Engineering ) course. This project project made by python language using Django Framework and opencv for taking snapshot also basic html, css, javascript, bootstrap. this is a simple project where a teacher can upload a file for students for reading, when students logged their account then they can see specific reading file and when they click on the file then file will be open on a tab and after certain times it will take snapshot from your laptop. this is still on working progress.
